# Traffic Sign Classification and Regularization ðŸš¦ðŸ“Š

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning project for traffic sign classification using the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)** dataset. The project includes a base CNN model and a regularized version using **Dropout** and **L2 regularization**, highlighting the importance of preventing overfitting.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is the **GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark**.  
It was organized into:

- `train/` â€“ contains labeled training images grouped by class.
- `val/` â€“ validation split from the training data for performance monitoring.

### ðŸ”¹ Regularized Model
- Dropout layers added after Dense layers
- L2 Regularization applied to Conv and Dense layers
- Learning Rate Scheduler used for better convergence
